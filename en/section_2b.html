      The EU framework for the protection of copyright and related rights in the digital environment is largely established by Directive 2001/29/EC<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote16anc" href="#sdfootnote16sym">16</a></sup> on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. Other EU directives in this field that are relevant in the online environment are those relating to the protection of software<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote17anc" href="#sdfootnote17sym">17</a></sup> and databases<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote18anc" href="#sdfootnote18sym">18</a></sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Directive 2001/29/EC harmonises the rights of authors and neighbouring rightholders<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote19anc" href="#sdfootnote19sym">19</a></sup> which are essential for the transmission of digital copies of works (e.g. an e-book) and other protected subject matter (e.g. a record in a MP3 format) over the internet or similar digital networks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most relevant rights for digital transmissions are the reproduction right, i.e. the right to authorise or prohibit the making of copies<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote20anc" href="#sdfootnote20sym">20</a></sup>, (notably relevant at the start of the transmission – e.g. the uploading of a digital copy of a work to a server in view of making it available – and at the users’ end – e.g. when a user downloads a digital copy of a work) and the communication to the public/making available right, i.e. the rights to authorise or prohibit the dissemination of the works in digital networks<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote21anc" href="#sdfootnote21sym">21</a></sup>. These rights are intrinsically linked in digital transmissions and both need to be cleared.
    </p>

    <h4>The act of “making available”</h4>
    <p>
      Directive 2001/29/EC specifies neither <U>wh</U><U>at</U> is covered by the making available right (e.g. the upload, the accessibility by the public, the actual reception by the public) nor <U>where</U> the act of “making available” takes place. This does not raise questions if the act is limited to a single territory. Questions arise however when the transmission covers several territories and rights need to be cleared (does the act of &quot;making available&quot; happen in the country of the upload only? in each of the countries where the content is potentially accessible? in each of the countries where the content is effectively accessed?). The most recent case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) suggests that a relevant criterion is the “targeting” of a certain Member State's public<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote22anc" href="#sdfootnote22sym">22</a></sup>. According to this approach the copyright-relevant act (which has to be licensed) occurs at least in those countries which are “targeted” by the online service provider. A service provider “targets” a group of customers residing in a specific country when it directs its activity to that group, e.g. via advertisement, promotions, a language or a currency specifically targeted at that group.

      Each act of transmission in digital networks entails (in the current state of technology and law) several reproductions. This means that there are two rights that apply to digital transmissions: the reproduction right and the making available right. This may complicate the licensing of works for online use notably when the two rights are held by different persons/entities.

      Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another. They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Several cases are pending before the CJEU<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote25anc" href="#sdfootnote25sym">25</a></sup> in which the question has been raised whether the provision of a&nbsp;clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder.

      A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache' memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEU<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote26anc" href="#sdfootnote26sym">26</a></sup> as to whether such copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

      Digital content is increasingly being bought via digital transmission (e.g. download to own). Questions arise as to the possibility for users to dispose of the files they buy in this manner (e.g. by selling them or by giving them as a gift). The principle of EU exhaustion of the distribution right applies in the case of the distribution of physical copies (e.g. when a tangible article such as a CD or a book, etc. is sold, the right holder cannot prevent the further distribution of that tangible article)<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote27anc" href="#sdfootnote27sym">27</a></sup>.
      The issue that arises here is whether this principle can also be applied in the case of an act of transmission equivalent in its effect to distribution (i.e.&nbsp;where the buyer acquires the property of the copy)<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote28anc" href="#sdfootnote28sym">28</a></sup>.
      This raises difficult questions, notably relating to the practical application of such an approach (how to avoid re-sellers keeping and using a copy of a work after they have “re-sold” it – this is often referred to as the “forward and delete” question) as well as to the economic implications of the creation of a&nbsp;second-hand market of copies of perfect quality that never deteriorate (in contrast to the second-hand market for physical goods).
