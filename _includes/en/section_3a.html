      Limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights enable the use of works and other protected subject-matter, without obtaining authorisation from the rightholders, for certain purposes and to a certain extent (for instance the use for illustration purposes of an extract from a novel by a teacher in a literature class). At EU level they are established in a number of copyright directives, most notably Directive 2001/29/EC<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote36anc" href="#sdfootnote36sym">36</a></sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exceptions and limitations in the national and EU copyright laws have to respect international law<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote37anc" href="#sdfootnote37sym">37</a></sup>. In accordance with international obligations, the EU acquis requires that limitations and exceptions can only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work or other subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the rightholders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas the catalogue of limitations and exceptions included in EU law is exhaustive (no other exceptions can be applied to the rights harmonised at EU level)<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote38anc" href="#sdfootnote38sym">38</a></sup>, these limitations and exceptions are often optional<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote39anc" href="#sdfootnote39sym">39</a></sup>, in the sense that Member States are free to reflect in national legislation as many or as few of them as they wish. Moreover, the formulation of certain of the limitations and exceptions is general enough to give significant flexibility to the Member States as to how, and to what extent, to implement them (if they decide to do so). Finally, it is worth noting that not all of the limitations and exceptions included in the EU legal framework for copyright are of equivalent significance in policy terms and in terms of their potential effect on the functioning of the Single Market.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, in the same manner that the definition of the rights is territorial (i.e. has an effect only within the territory of the Member State), the definition of the limitations and exceptions to the rights is territorial too (so an act that is covered by an exception in a Member State &quot;A&quot; may still require the authorisation of the rightholder once we move to the Member State &quot;B&quot;)<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote40anc" href="#sdfootnote40sym">40</a></sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cross-border effect of limitations and exceptions also raises the question of fair compensation of rightholders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate rightholders for the harm inflicted on them by a limitation or exception to their rights. In other instances Member States are not obliged, but may decide, to provide for such compensation. If a limitation or exception triggering a mechanism of fair compensation were to be given cross-border effect (e.g. the books are used for illustration in an online course given by an university in a Member State &quot;A&quot; and the students are in a Member State &quot;B&quot;) then there would also be a need to clarify which national law should determine the level of that compensation and who should pay it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the question of flexibility and adaptability is being raised: what is the best mechanism to ensure that the EU and Member States’ regulatory frameworks adapt when necessary (either to clarify that certain uses are covered by an exception or to confirm that for certain uses the authorisation of rightholders is required)? The main question here is whether a greater degree of flexibility can be introduced in the EU and Member States regulatory framework while ensuring the required legal certainty, including for the functioning of the Single Market, and respecting the EU's international obligations.

      Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to reflect in their national law a range of limitations and exceptions for the benefit of publicly accessible libraries, educational establishments and museums, as well as archives. If implemented, these exceptions allow acts of preservation and archiving<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote41anc" href="#sdfootnote41sym">41</a></sup><sup> </sup>and enable on-site consultation of the works and other subject matter in the collections of such institutions<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote42anc" href="#sdfootnote42sym">42</a></sup>. The public lending (under an exception or limitation) by these establishments of physical copies of works and other subject matter is governed by the Rental and Lending Directive<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote43anc" href="#sdfootnote43sym">43</a></sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Questions arise as to whether the current framework continues to achieve the objectives envisaged or whether it needs to be clarified or updated to cover use in digital networks. At the same time, questions arise as to the effect of such a possible expansion on the normal exploitation of works and other subject matter and as to the prejudice this may cause to rightholders. The role of licensing and possible framework agreements between different stakeholders also needs to be considered here.
    </p>
    <h4>Preservation and archiving</h4>
    <p>
      The preservation of the copies of works or other subject-matter held in the collections of cultural establishments (e.g. books, records, or films) – the restoration or replacement of works, the copying of fragile works - may involve the creation of another copy/ies of these works or other subject matter. Most Member States provide for an exception in their national laws allowing for the making of such preservation copies. The scope of the exception differs from Member State to Member State (as regards the type of beneficiary establishments, the types of works/subject-matter covered by the exception, the mode of copying and the number of reproductions that a beneficiary establishment may make). Also, the current legal status of new types of preservation activities (e.g. harvesting and archiving publicly available web content) is often uncertain.

      Directive 2001/29/EC provides an exception for the consultation of works and other subject-matter (consulting an e-book, watching a documentary) via dedicated terminals on the premises of such establishments for the purpose of research and private study. The online consultation of works and other subject-matter remotely (i.e. when the library user is not on the premises of the library) requires authorisation and is generally addressed in agreements between universities/libraries and publishers. Some argue that the law rather than agreements should provide for the possibility to, and the conditions for, granting online access to collections.

      Traditionally, public libraries have loaned physical copies of works (i.e. books, sometimes also CDs and DVDs) to their users. Recent technological developments have made it technically possible for libraries to provide users with temporary access to digital content, such as e-books, music or films via networks. Under the current legal framework, libraries need to obtain the authorisation of the rights holders to organise such e-lending activities. In various Member States, publishers and libraries are currently experimenting with different business models for the making available of works online, including direct supply of e-books to libraries by publishers or bundling by aggregators.

      The term “mass digitisation” is normally used to refer to efforts by institutions such as libraries and archives to digitise (e.g. scan) the entire content or part of their collections with an objective to preserve these collections and, normally, to make them available to the public.  Examples are efforts by libraries to digitise novels form the early part of the 20<sup>th</sup> century or whole collections of pictures of historical value. This matter has been partly addressed at the EU level by the 2011 Memorandum of&nbsp;Understanding (MoU) on key principles on the digitisation and making available of out of&nbsp;commerce works (i.e. works which are no longer found in the normal channels of commerce), which is aiming to facilitate mass digitisation efforts (for books and learned journals) on the basis of licence agreements between libraries and similar cultural institutions on the one hand and the collecting societies representing authors and publishers on the other<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote44anc" href="#sdfootnote44sym">44</a></sup>.
      Provided the required funding is ensured (digitisation projects are extremely expensive), the result of this MoU should be that books that are currently to be found only in the archives of, for instance, libraries will be digitised and made available online to everyone. The MoU is based on voluntary licences (granted by Collective Management Organisations on the basis of the mandates they receive from authors and publishers). Some Member States may need to enact legislation to ensure the largest possible effect of such licences (e.g. by establishing in legislation a&nbsp;presumption of representation of a&nbsp;collecting society or the recognition of an “extended effect” to the licences granted)<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote45anc" href="#sdfootnote45sym">45</a></sup>.
